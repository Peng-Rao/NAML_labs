This repository contains the code for the labs of the course "Numerical analysis for machine learning" at Polimi in academic year 24/25. It also records the progress of the lab sessions.

## Lab 1

Hands-on exercises include:

1. performing SVD for image compression visualizing the result and the rank-1 components;
2. geometric interpretation of PCA showing how data is transformed to new axis;
3. an application of SVD to background removal in a video

## Lab 2

1. Implementation of the Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (rSVD) with a comparison with the full SVD.
2. Analysis of the ovarian cancer dataset and the mnist dataset using PCA implemented with SVD.
